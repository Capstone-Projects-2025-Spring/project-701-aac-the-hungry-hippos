## Keywords

Section #, as well as any words that quickly give your peers insights into the application like programming language, development platform, type of application, etc.

## Project Overview

This document proposes an application of an innovative tool to enhance Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices for children. Our goal is to integrate fun, interactive games that encourage social interaction while providing essential communication support for AAC users. By combining play with practical communication tools, we aim to reduce social isolation and make communication more accessible and enjoyable for children who rely on AAC. 

## High Level Requirement

### What the Product Does

- Provides accessible communication options, including symbols, buttons, and text-to-speech features, enabling children with limited speech to express themselves effectively.
- Offers engaging, inclusive games designed to encourage interaction among AAC users and their peers.
- Promotes social interaction and inclusion, helping to reduce feelings of isolation in children who rely on AAC.

### How the Product Does It

- Features a user-friendly interface with accessibility-focused design elements such as large icons, minimal text, and visual aids.
- Integrates communication tools directly within gameplay, allowing seamless interaction and expression during play.
- Supports customizable communication options tailored to individual user needs and preferences.
- Ensures the experience is visually engaging, intuitive, and responsive to the motor and cognitive abilities of young AAC users.

## Conceptual Design

Describe the initial design concept: Hardware/software architecture, programming language, operating system, etc.

## Background

The background will contain a more detailed description of the product and a comparison to existing similar projects/products. A literature search should be conducted and the results listed. Proper citation of sources is required. If there are similar open-source products, you should state whether existing source will be used and to what extent. If there are similar closed-source/proprietary products, you should state how the proposed product will be similar and different.

## Required Resources

Discuss what you need to develop this project. This includes background information you will need to acquire, hardware resources, and software resources. If these are not part of the standard Computer Science Department lab resources, these must be identified early and discussed with the instructor.
